# Device Client - Docs

The `device-client` python package is a separate component from any other Exosite gateway technology. By using the [modularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_programming) principle in its design, this protocol layer can be modified or replaced with the consumers needing no modification. The `gwe` product consumes the `device-client` as a library for all communications with the Exosite API. This means the `device-client`, within the Edge Gateway ecosystem, is globally available for other programs like custom gateway applications.
