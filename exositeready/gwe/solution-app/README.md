# ExositeReady™ Gateway Engine Solution App

This guide provides an example solution displaying all the telemetric data from ExositeReady™ Gateway Engine (GWE) as well as showing a custom gateway application: "gmq-sine-demo." For additional information and resources, please refer to the GWE documentation [home page](http://docs.exosite.com/exositeready/gwe/).

# Requirements

This guide requires the installation of GWE on your gateway hardware device. These installation instructions can be found in the [GWE Getting-started Guide](http://docs.exosite.com/exositeready/gwe/getting_started/).

**NOTE:** This is a technical tutorial. You will need some familiarity with your operating system’s terminal.
