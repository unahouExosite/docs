The nodes often have 8-bit microcontrollers with small amounts of ROM and RAM, while constrained networks such as 6LoWPAN often have high packet error rates and a typical throughput of 10s of kbit/s. The protocol is designed for machine-to-machine (M2M) applications such as smart energy and building automation.\nCoAP provides a request/response interaction model between application endpoints, supports built-in discovery of services and resources, and includes key concepts of the Web such as URIs and Internet media types. CoAP is designed to easily interface with HTTP for integration with the Web while meeting specialized requirements such as multicast support, very low overhead and simplicity for constrained environments.\nFor more information on the CoAP protocol see [RFC7252](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7252).\n","preview":"<p>This api is currently released as a beta and may be updated at any time.</p>\n"},{"path":"/coap/#timeseries-data-procedures","title":"CoAP -> CoAP API -> Procedures -> Timeseries Data Procedures","body":"[Write](#write) - write new data to a set of dataports\n[Read](#read) - read the latest data from a set of dataports\n[Observed Read](#observed-read) - be notified immediately when a dataport is updated\n[Multiple Read and Write](#multiple-read-and-write) - write a set of dataports, then read a set of dataports\n","preview":"<p><a href=\"#write\">Write</a> - write new data to a set of dataports</p>\n"},{"path":"/coap/#provisioning-procedures","title":"CoAP -> CoAP API -> Procedures -> Provisioning Procedures","body":"[Activate](#activate) - activate device and get device's CIK\n[List Content IDs](#list-content-ids) - get a list of content available to device\n[Get Content Info](#get-content-info) - get meta information about content file\n[Download Content](#download-content) - get content file\n","preview":"<p><a href=\"#activate\">Activate</a> - activate device and get device&#39;s CIK</p>\n"},{"path":"/coap/#utility-procedures","title":"CoAP -> CoAP API -> Procedures -> Utility Procedures","body":"[Timestamp](#timestamp) - get the current unix timestamp\n[Remote Procedure Call Proxy](#remote-procedure-call-proxy) - proxy CBOR-RPC calls to the [JSON-RPC](/rpc) API\n","preview":"<p><a href=\"#timestamp\">Timestamp</a> - get the current unix timestamp</p>\n"},{"path":"/coap/#libraries-and-sample-code","title":"CoAP -> CoAP API -> Libraries and Sample Code","body":"A sample CoAP client written in python is available in the [CoAPExample](https://github.com/exosite-garage/CoAPExample) repository.\n","preview":"<p>A sample CoAP client written in python is available in the <a href=\"https://github.com/exosite-garage/CoAPExample\">CoAPExample</a> repository.</p>\n"},{"path":"/coap/#notational-conventions","title":"CoAP -> CoAP API -> Notational Conventions","body":"This document uses a few notational conventions:\nA name in angle brackets, e.g. `<myvar>`, is a placeholder that will be defined elsewhere.\nCoAP request packets are shown in a text format with the format `METHOD: URI\\nPAYLOAD`.\n","preview":"<p>This document uses a few notational conventions:</p>\n"},{"path":"/coap/#coap-responses","title":"CoAP -> CoAP API -> CoAP Responses","body":"CoAP makes use of so called CoAP Response Codes which resemble the HTTP status codes defined in [RFC7231](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6) plus some CoAP-specific status codes.

Generally devices don't use this API since it is relatively complicated and the JSON format is rather heavy and hard to parse and construct, but luckily for you, we've setup a proxy that will translate the HTTP + JSON format that that API uses into a CoAP + CBOR format which drastically brings down the requirements needed to use it.\nSee the [RPC API docs](https://github.com/exosite/docs/blob/master/rpc) for more information about using this API. The JSON of that API maps one to one the CBOR that you will receive and be expected to send.\nYou can also request that the JSON be passed straight through by sending an 'Accept' option with 'application/json'.\nResponses that are longer than about 1500 bytes will need to be downloaded using block transfers.\nThe payloads for both writing and the returned values for reading are in the CBOR (Concise Binary Object Representation) format.

Long polling is a method of getting a server push without the complexities of setting up publicly accessible HTTP server endpoints on your device. As the name suggests, long polling is similar to normal polling of an HTTP resource, but instead of requiring the client to make a new request to the server constantly, the server will wait to return until it has new information to return to the client (or a timeout has been reached).\nTo perform a request with long polling simply add the header `Request-Timeout: <miliseconds>` to your request. The server will then wait until a new datapoint is written to the given dataport and will then immediately return the value. If no datapoint is written before that time a `304 Not Modified` is returned and the client may make another long poling request to continue monitoring that dataport.\nYou may also optionally add an `If-Modified-Since` header to specify a start time to wait. This is exactly the same as the `alias.last` semantics in scripting.

Since you want to define what data will go in the device you are creating, choose this option.\n __NOTE:__ Generic and unlisted devices are both private. The term \"unlisted\" here indicates that you want to add a device based on a model that is unlisted. For example, you would choose an unlisted device if you had a hardware development kit that already had a model name created on Exosite. In this case, the manufacturer would provide you with an unlisted model identifier created specifically to work with the kit’s firmware.\nOn the *Device Setup* tab:\nEnsure the *Device Type* drop-down menu is set to generic.\nSelect your timezone from the *Device Timezone* drop-down menu.\nEnter a location in the *Device Location *field. The location can be anything that indicates the device’s location, but it cannot be left blank. In the example below, the location is set to office.\nUnder the *Device Specific Limits *heading, you can restrict a device’s resource consumption. For this example, select the radio button labeled \"Inherit\" for each option, which allows the device to use as much of its parent portal’s resource limits as it needs. The “Custom” setting might be used, for example, to ensure that an SMS alert limit is shared equally among devices in a portal.\nClick Continue.\n![image alt text](images/image_6.png)\nOn the *Confirm* tab, enter a name for your device in the *New Device Name *field.

Long polling is a method of getting a server push without the complexities of setting up publicly accessible HTTP server endpoints on your device. As the name suggests, long polling is similar to normal polling of an HTTP resource, but instead of requiring the client to make a new request to the server constantly, the server will wait to return until it has new information to return to the client (or a timeout has been reached).\nTo perform a request with long polling simply add the header `Request-Timeout: <miliseconds>` to your request. The server will then wait until a new datapoint is written to the given dataport and will then immediately return the value. If no datapoint is written before that time a `304 Not Modified` is returned and the client may make another long poling request to continue monitoring that dataport.\nYou may also optionally add an `If-Modified-Since` header to specify a start time to wait. This is exactly the same as the `alias.last` semantics in scripting. You will want to use this if it's important that you receive all updates to a given dataport, otherwise it is possible to miss points that get written between long polling requests.\nNote: Only one dataport may be read at a time when using long polling.\nGET /onep:v1/stack/alias?<alias 1> HTTP/1.1\nHost: m2.exosite.com\nX-Exosite-CIK: <CIK>\nAccept: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=utf-8\nRequest-Timeout: <timeout>\nIf-Modified-Since: <timestamp>\n<blank line>\n`<alias>` is the alias you monitor for new datapoints.\n`Request-Timeout` specifies the how long to wait on changes.  `<timeout>` is a millisecond value and cannot be more than 300 seconds (300000 ms).\n`If-Modified-Since` specifies waiting on aliases since the `<timestamp>`.  `<timestamp>` can be timestamp seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC or standard <a href=http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html>HTTP-Date</a> format.
