# Guide: Create a Product

The product you create is the virtual representation of the physical hardware and sensors that will send data to the Murano platform. 

## Web UI

To create a new product using the Web UI:

1. Navigate to the following URL: 
   [https://www.exosite.io/business/products](https://www.exosite.io/business/products)

   ![new product](../assets/new_product.png)

1. Click on "+ NEW PRODUCT." 

1. Name your product. Note: Your product name cannot contain any capital letters.

## Murano CLI

To create a new product using the Murano CLI:

```sh
$ murano product create <name>
```

This command will return the ID of your product for the next step.

# Configure Your Product

To configure your product you can use the config command of the Murano CLI tool. This command tells Murano CLI which product to use. 

```sh
$ murano config product.id <productid>
```

Executing the command below will set the product definition for this example as defined in the `specs/resources.yaml` file. 

```
$ murano syncup --specs
```
This command sets up all of the data aliases in the spec file. You can now see them by going to [https://www.exosite.io/business/products](https://www.exosite.io/business/products) and clicking the 'Definition' tab. These are all the different resources that will used by your hardware.
