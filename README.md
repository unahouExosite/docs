# Overview
The easiest way to think about the Murano platform is as a number of cloud software layers that are integrated together, simplifying an IoT 'stack'.  Murano has taken care of the infrastructure, development and integration of the functional layers, and integration with third-party software - allowing developers to focus on user application specific functionality, device applications, and getting to market much quicker than building a system themselves.  

The Murano layers include device connectivity, device/product management, data routing, service integration (services like data stores, alerting, and third-party analytic platforms), application public APIs, user auth/roles/permissions, and application asset hosting.  

Murano allows developers to build a full IoT system prototype quickly, then have flexibility to continue to add other features and build out customizations.  


# Murano Features
## Products
The Product functionality of Murano provides tools and interfaces to manage a product models, allowing a fleet of devices to be deployed using a common unique API hostname, provisioning sequence, definition for data routing, and content for things like infield updates and configuration.  Developers can quickly build a product, connect devices, and verify device data flow using integrated prototyping dashboards.

## Solutions
The Solution functionality of Murano provides tools and interfaces to build and deploy applications and services on top of IoT device data using concepts of data routing, integrated services, custom APIs, user auth/roles/permissions, and application asset hosting.  This allows developers to create solution projects that contain the entire application functionality to deploy to end users or to provide a custom API for their products.
