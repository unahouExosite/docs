# HTTP Device API Overview

This is the HTTP Device API for the Murano Platform. Device firmware and applications should use this API to provision and interact with the platform.  Devices use resources to read from and write to, like a variable.  


# Procedures
### Timeseries Data Procedures
* [Write](#write) - write new data to a set of resources
* [Read](#read) - read the latest data from a set of resources
* [Hybrid Write/Read](#hybrid-writeread) - write a set of resources, then read a set of resources
* [Long-Polling](#long-polling) - be notified immediately when a resource is updated

### Product Device Provisioning Procedures
* [Activate](#activate) - activate device and get device's CIK
* [List Available Content](#list-available-content) - get a list of content available to device
* [Get Content Info](#get-content-info) - get meta information about content file
* [Download Content](#download-content) - get content file

### Utility Procedures
* [Timestamp](#timestamp) - get the current unix timestamp

## Libraries and Sample Code

Sample code that uses this API can be found on the Murano Getting Started product examples:

* [Murano Getting Started Product Examples](/murano/get-started/)

## Notational Conventions

This document uses a few notational conventions:

* JSON is pretty printed for clarity. The extra whitespace is not included in the RPC JSON.
* Comments (`//`) are occasionally included in JSON to give hints or provide detail. These comments are not included in actual requests or responses.
* A name in angle brackets (e.g., `<myvar>` is a placeholder that will be defined elsewhere)
* `number` indicates a number (e.g., 42)
* `string` represents a string (e.g., "MySensor")
* `|` represents multiple choice
* `=` represents default value
* `...` represents one or more of the previous items

## Hostname/Host
Although all examples use the server hostname and host header of "m2.exosite.com," device firmware and applications should use the Murano Product ID in the hostname: `<productid>.m2.exosite.com`.  

```
   Host: myproductid.m2.exosite.com
```

## HTTP Responses

Typical HTTP response codes include:

| Code   | Response      | Description                                          |
| ------ |:--------------|:-----------------------------------------------------|
| 200    | OK            | Successful request, returning requested values       |
| 204    | No Content    | Successful request, nothing will be returned         |
| 4xx    | Client Error  | There was an error\* with the request by the client  |
| 401    | Unauthorized  | No or invalid CIK                                    |
| 5xx    | Server Error  | There was an error with the request on the server    |

_\* Note: aliases that are not found are not considered errors in the request. See the documentation for [read](#read), [write](#write), and [Hybrid write/read](#hybrid-writeread) for details._


# Data Procedures

## Write

Write one or more resources of `<alias>` with given `<value>`. The client (e.g., device or portal) is identified by `<CIK>`. Data is written with the server timestamp as of the time the data was received by the server. Data cannot be written faster than a rate of once per second; doing so results in undefined behavior. If multiple aliases are specified, they are written at the same timestamp.


### request

```
POST /onep:v1/stack/alias HTTP/1.1 
Host: m2.exosite.com 
X-Exosite-CIK: <CIK> 
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=utf-8 
Content-Length: <length> 
<blank line>
<alias 1>=<value 1>&<alias 2...>=<value 2...>&<alias n>=<value n>
```


### response

```
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content 
Date: <date> 
Server: <server> 
Connection: Close 
Content-Length: 0 
<blank line>
```

* See [HTTP Responses](#http-responses) for a full list of responses.


### example

```
$ curl https://m2.exosite.com/onep:v1/stack/alias \
    -H 'X-Exosite-CIK: <CIK>' \
    -H 'Accept: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=utf-8' \
    -d '<alias>=<value>'
```


## Read

Read the most recent value from one or more resources with `<alias>`. The client (e.g., device or portal) to read from is identified by `<CIK>`. If at least one `<alias>` is found and has data, data will be returned.


### request

```
GET /onep:v1/stack/alias?<alias 1>&<alias 2...>&<alias n> HTTP/1.1
Host: m2.exosite.com
X-Exosite-CIK: <CIK>
Accept: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=utf-8
<blank line>
```


### response

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: <date>
Server: <server>
Connection: Close
Content-Length: <length>
<blank line>
<alias 1>=<value 1>&<alias 2...>=<value 2...>&<alias n>=<value n>
```

* Response may also be `HTTP/1.1 204 No Content` if either none of the aliases are found or they are all empty of data
* See [HTTP Responses](#http-responses) for a full list of responses


### example

```
$ curl https://m2.exosite.com/onep:v1/stack/alias?<dataport-alias> \
    -H 'X-Exosite-CIK: <CIK>' \
    -H 'Accept: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=utf-8'
```


## Hybrid write/read

Write one or more resources of `<alias w>` with given `<value>` and then read the most recent value from one or more resources with `<alias r>`. The client (e.g., device, portal) to write to and read from is identified by `<CIK>`. All writes occur before all reads.


### request

```
POST /onep:v1/stack/alias?<alias r1>&<alias r2...>&<alias rn> HTTP/1.1
Host: m2.exosite.com
X-Exosite-CIK: <CIK>
Accept: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=utf-8
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: <length>
<blank line>
<alias w1>=<value 1>&<alias w2...>=<value 2...>&<alias wn>=<value n>
```


### response

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: <date>
Server: <server>
Connection: Close
Content-Length: <length>
<blank line>
<alias r1>=<value 1>&<alias r2...>=<value 2...>&<alias rn>=<value n>
```

* Response may also be `HTTP/1.1 204 No Content` if either none of the aliases are found or they are all empty of data
* See [HTTP Responses](#http-responses) for a full list of responses


### example

```
$ curl https://m2.exosite.com/onep:v1/stack/alias?<alias_to_read> \
    -H 'X-Exosite-CIK: <CIK>' \
    -H 'Accept: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=utf-8' \
    -d '<alias_to_write>=<value>'
```


## Long Polling

The [read](#read) procedure now supports long polling. Long polling is a method of getting a server push without the complexities of setting up publicly accessible HTTP server endpoints on your device. As the name suggests, long polling is similar to normal polling of an HTTP resource, but instead of requiring the client to make a new request to the server constantly, the server will wait to return until it has new information to return to the client (or a timeout has been reached).

To perform a request with long polling, simply add the header `Request-Timeout: <miliseconds>` to your request. The server will then wait until a new datapoint is written to the given resource and will then immediately return the value. If no datapoint is written before that time, a `304 Not Modified` is returned and the client may make another long polling request to continue monitoring that resource.

You may also optionally add an `If-Modified-Since` header to specify a start time to wait. This is exactly the same as the `alias.last` semantics in scripting. You will want to use this if it's important that you receive all updates to a given resource; otherwise it is possible to miss points that get written between long polling requests.

Note: only one resource may be read at a time when using long polling.


### request

```
GET /onep:v1/stack/alias?<alias 1> HTTP/1.1
Host: m2.exosite.com
X-Exosite-CIK: <CIK>
Accept: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=utf-8
Request-Timeout: <timeout>
If-Modified-Since: <timestamp>
<blank line>
```

* `<alias>` is the alias you monitor for new datapoints.
* `Request-Timeout` specifies how long to wait on changes. `<timeout>` is a millisecond value and cannot be more than 300 seconds (300,000 ms).
* `If-Modified-Since` specifies waiting on aliases since the `<timestamp>`. `<timestamp>` can be timestamp seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC or standard <a href=http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html>HTTP-Date</a> format. If this is not specified, it defaults to "now."


### response

When the resource is updated:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: <date>
Server: <server>
Connection: Close
Content-Length: <length>
Last-Modified: <datapoint-modification-date>
<blank line>
<alias>=<value>
```

If the resource is not updated before timeout:

```
HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified
Date: <date>
Server: <server>
Connection: Close
Content-Length: <length>
<blank line>
```

When the resource is updated and a value is returned, a `Last-Modified` header is included. When it is vital for your application to receive all updates to a resource, you can pass the `Last-Modified` header value back to the `If-Not-Modified-Since` header in your next request to make sure you don't miss any points that may have been written since the last request returned.


### example

```
$ curl https://m2.exosite.com/onep:v1/stack/alias?<dataport-alias> \
    -H 'X-Exosite-CIK: <CIK>' \
    -H 'Accept: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=utf-8'
    -H 'Request-Timeout: 30000
    -H 'If-Modified-Since: 1408088308
```


# Provisioning Procedures

## Activate

Activates and returns the `<CIK>` for the associated device's identity `<sn>` administrated for the Product ID `<vendor>` and `<model>` by Murano.
The device's identity must be added to the Product in Murano.

```
POST /provision/activate HTTP/1.1
Host: <productid>.m2.exosite.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: <length>

vendor=<productid>&model=<productid>&sn=<identity>
```


### response

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: <date>
Server: <server>
Connection: Keep-Alive
Content-Length: <length>
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8

<cik>
```

Response may also be:

* `HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found` if the client described by `<vendor>`, `<model>`, `<sn>` is not found on the system.
* `HTTP/1.1 409 Conflict` if the identity is not enabled for activation.
* See [HTTP Responses](#http-responses) for a full list of responses


### example

This command activates a device with identity 12345678 and returns its CIK.

```
$ curl https://m2.exosite.com/provision/activate \
    -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=utf-8" \
    -d "vendor=mysubdomain&model=myclientmodel&sn=12345678"
```


## List Available Content

List content `<id>`s. Caller with `<DeviceCIK>` must have an activated
identity in given `<vendor>` `<model>` name space.

```
GET /provision/download?vendor=<vendor>&model=<model> HTTP/1.1
Host: m2.exosite.com
X-Exosite-CIK: <CIK>
Content-Length: <length>
<blank line>
```

### response

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: <date>
Server: <server>
Connection: Keep-Alive
Content-Length: <length>
Content-Type: text/csv; charset=utf-8

<id 1>
<id 2...>
<id n>
```

Response may also be:

* `HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden` if the `<vendor>` and `<model>` pair is invalid.
* See [HTTP Responses](#http-responses) for a full list of responses


## Download Content

If caller with `<CIK>` has an activated SN in given `<vendor>` `<model>` name
space, and is authorized for the content, then the `<id>` content blob, or its
requested range, is returned. The header `Range: bytes=<range-specifier>`, if
specified, allows the caller to request a chunk of bytes at a time.
`<range-specifier>` takes the form of `X-Y` where both `X` and `Y` are
optional but at least one of them must be present. `X` is the start byte
position to return. `Y` is the end position. Both are 0 based. If `X` is
omitted, `Y` will request the last `Y` count of bytes of the content. If `Y`
is omitted, it will default to the end of the content. Note that `Content-Type`
of `<blob>` is based on the type set in the `POST` to
`/provision/manage/content/<model>/<id>`.

```
GET /provision/download?vendor=<vendor>&model=<model>&id=<id> HTTP/1.1
Host: m2.exosite.com
X-Exosite-CIK: <CIK>
{Range: bytes=<range-specifier>}
<blank line>
```


### response

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: <date>
Server: <server>
Connection: Keep-Alive
{Accept-Ranges: bytes}
Content-Length: <number of bytes being returned>
{Content-Range: bytes <first position>-<last position>/<total length>}
Content-Type: <content-type>

<blob>
```

Response may also be:

* `HTTP/1.1 206 Partial Content` if the response is partial.
* `HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden` if the `<vendor>` and `<model>` pair is invalid.
* See [HTTP Responses](#http-responses) for a full list of responses


## Get Content Info

If caller with `<CIK>` has an activated SN in given `<vendor>` `<model>` name
space, and is authorized for the content, then the `<id>` content information
is returned.

```
GET /provision/download?vendor=<vendor>&model=<model>&id=<id>&info=true HTTP/1.1
Host: m2.exosite.com
X-Exosite-CIK: <CIK>
Content-Length: <length>
<blank line>
```


### response

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: <date>
Server: <server>
Connection: Keep-Alive
Content-Length: <length>
Content-Type: text/csv; charset=utf-8

<content-type>,<byte-size>,<updated-timestamp>,<meta>
```

Response may also be:

* `HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request` if the `<vendor>` and `<model>` pair is invalid.
